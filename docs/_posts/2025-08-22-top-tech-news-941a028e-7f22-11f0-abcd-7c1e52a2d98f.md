> Founding Full-Stack Engineer
Ready to build the next generation of AI-native consumer experience?
Text.ai (http://Text.ai) is a consumer-first AI native company, revolutionizing how people communicate in group chats.
We're pioneering an entirely new category of consumer AI products that millions will use daily. We are building the first AI-native communication platform, where every conversation becomes intelligent, collaborative, and effortless. We're reimagining how humans and AI work together from first principles.
While everyone else builds individual AI assistants, we're solving the hardest problem in consumer AI: making multiple humans happy simultaneously through true group intelligence.
Our AI doesn't just respond to prompts. It stays, learns, thinks, and adapts to make every human connection better. From planning the perfect group trip to finding restaurants everyone will love, we transform chaotic group coordination into effortless collaboration.
The future isn't prompt → response.
It's presence → understanding → creation.
We are backed by Y-Combinator, SV Angel, and angel investors from Shopify and Tencent, with founders from Ex-Tesla, Eventbrite, Amazon, & McKinsey.
