\
Now we're building something bigger: the system of record for scientists where they can find papers, analyze experiments, and write their drafts while collaborating with other scientists as well as our AI agents. \
\
You should apply if you:\
\
→ Ship fast and learn faster \
→ Know the agentic AI stack cold (vector DBs, graph RAG, agent memory) \
→ Have built full-stack products that scaled past 1M users \
→ Actually care about accelerating scientific discovery\
\
Bonus: You've published research yourself. \
\
Don't apply if you:\
\
→ Can't be in SF, in person \
→ Haven't used the product yet \
→ Don't want to talk to customers \
\
$120K-$200K + equity. We're a small team backed by YC. \
