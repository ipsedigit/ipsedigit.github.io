### [Redis is fast – I'll cache in Postgres](https://dizzy.zone/2025/09/24/Redis-is-fast-Ill-cache-in-Postgres/)

> There are books & many articles online, like this one arguing for using Postgres for everything. I thought I’d take a look at one use case - using Postgres instead of Redis for caching. I work with APIs quite a bit, so I’d build a super simple HTTP server that responds with data from that cache. I’d start from Redis as this is something I frequently encounter at work, switch it out to Postgres using unlogged tables and see if there’s a difference.
