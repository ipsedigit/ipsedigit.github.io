### [If you're building a JavaScript library and need logging, you would love LogTape](https://hackers.pub/@hongminhee/2025/logtape-for-libraries)

> LogTape offers a novel approach to logging in JavaScript libraries, designed to provide diagnostic capabilities without imposing choices on users. Unlike traditional methods such as using debug packages or custom logging systems, LogTape operates on a "library-first design" where logging is transparent and only activated when configured. This eliminates the fragmentation problem of managing multiple logging systems across different libraries. With zero dependencies and support for both ESM and CommonJS, LogTape ensures minimal impact on users' projects, avoiding dependency conflicts and enabling tree shaking. Its universal runtime support and efficient performance make it suitable for various environments. By using a hierarchical category system, LogTape prevents namespace collisions, offering a seamless developer experience with TypeScript support and structured logging patterns. LogTape provides adapters for popular logging libraries like Winston and Pino, bridging the transition for users invested in other systems. Ultimately, LogTape offers a way to enhance library capabilities while respecting users' preferences and existing choices, making it a valuable consideration for library authors.
